Write a program to input and test if entered numbers are magic squares. 
A simple magic square is where all the numbers in the square add to the same value across the rows, columns and diagonal.

16	11	18	=45
17	15	13	=45
12	19	14	=45
=45	=45	=45	=45

Your program should also check if the square is a Lo Shu magic square. 
A Lo Shu magic square is a magic square that uses only the digits 1 to 9, without repeating a digit.

2	7	6	=15
9	5	1	=15
4	3	8	=15
=15	=15	=15	=15

Your program should allow a user to enter a magic square, then display the square and display if the square is magic, and if the square is a Lo Shu.
